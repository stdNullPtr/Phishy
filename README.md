## ‚ú® Features

- **Out-of-process operation** - Uses Windows API hooks without injecting into the game
- **Universal compatibility** - Works with any WoW version (Classic, TBC, WotLK, Retail)
- **Audio-based detection** - Detects fish by monitoring Windows master volume
- **Cursor change detection** - Identifies bobber location via cursor icon changes
- **Automatic lure application** - Supports up to two different lures with configurable timers
- **Wintergrasp support** - Automatically logs out during Wintergrasp battles (WotLK)
- **State machine architecture** - Predictable and debuggable behavior
- **Configuration validation** - Clear error messages for misconfigured settings
- **Resource efficient** - Minimal CPU usage with optimized polling

## üîß How It Works

Phishy uses a clever combination of Windows APIs to automate fishing without reading or modifying game memory:

1. **The Eyes** üëÅÔ∏è - Monitors cursor icon changes (`EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE`) to detect when hovering over the fishing bobber
2. **The Ears** üëÇ - Listens for volume spikes in Windows master audio to detect fish splashing
3. **The Brain** üß† - State machine that coordinates the fishing process
4. **The Hands** ‚úã - Simulates mouse clicks and keyboard inputs to catch fish

### State Machine Flow

```
Start ‚Üí Apply Lure (optional) ‚Üí Cast Line ‚Üí Find Bobber ‚Üí Wait for Fish ‚Üí Catch Fish ‚Üí Repeat
                                                                    ‚Üì
                                                          Logout (Wintergrasp) ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Login
```

## üíª Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (Windows-specific APIs)
- **.NET Runtime**: .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime
- **Development** (if building from source):
  - Visual Studio 2022 with .NET Desktop workload
  - .NET 7.0/8.0 SDK

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/stdNullPtr/Phishy/releases) page
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice
3. Run `guess.exe` (intentionally generic name)
4. On first run, a `configuration.yaml` file will be created and opened in Notepad
5. Configure the settings according to your WoW setup (see [Configuration](#configuration))
6. Run `guess.exe` again to start fishing

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stdNullPtr/Phishy.git
   cd Phishy
   ```

2. Open `Phishy.sln` in Visual Studio 2022

3. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B) in Release mode

4. Find the executable at: `Phishy\bin\Release\net7.0-windows\guess.exe`

Alternatively, using the command line:
```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The bot uses a YAML configuration file (`configuration.yaml`) with the following options:

```yaml
# Window Configuration
game-window-name: World of Warcraft  # Must match your WoW window title exactly

# Keybinds (use lowercase letters)
keyboard-key-start-fishing: 1        # Key bound to fishing ability
keyboard-key-apply-lure: 2          # Key bound to first lure (optional)
keyboard-key-apply-second-lure: 3   # Key bound to second lure (optional)
keyboard-key-logout: l              # Key bound to /logout macro (for Wintergrasp)

# Lure Settings
lure-buff-duration-minutes: 10      # Duration of first lure buff
second-lure-buff-duration-minutes: 5 # Duration of second lure buff (optional)

# Fishing Settings
fishing-channel-duration-seconds: 21 # How long to wait for a fish (default: 21)

# Audio Settings
setup-sound: true                   # Auto-configure Windows volume settings

# Wintergrasp Settings (WotLK only)
wait-for-wintergrasp: false         # Enable Wintergrasp logout/login cycle
```

### Configuration Tips

- **Window Name**: Must match exactly (case-sensitive). Common values:
  - `World of Warcraft` (Retail/Classic)
  - `World of Warcraft Classic`
  - Custom names if you've renamed your window
  
- **Keybinds**: Use single lowercase letters or numbers that match your in-game keybinds

- **Lure Duration**: Set slightly lower than actual buff duration to ensure reapplication

- **Channel Duration**: Default is 21 seconds, increase if you have fishing skill bonuses

## üìã Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **In-game preparation**:
   - Bind your fishing ability to key `1` (or configure differently)
   - Bind your lure(s) to keys `2` and `3` (optional)
   - Create a `/logout` macro and bind it (for Wintergrasp feature)
   - Position yourself at a fishing spot
   - Zoom in completely (first-person view works best)
   - Set game sound to ~80%, disable ambient sounds

2. **Windows preparation**:
   - The bot will automatically set Windows volume to maximum and mute it
   - Ensure no other applications are making sounds

3. **Running the bot**:
   - Start `guess.exe`
   - Focus the WoW window
   - The bot will begin fishing automatically
   - Press `DELETE` key to stop

### Best Practices

- Test manual fishing first to ensure bobber lands near screen center
- Fish in quiet areas to avoid sound interference
- Keep the WoW window in focus and don't minimize it
- Don't move the mouse while the bot is running

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed retrieving window handle"**
- Ensure the window name in config matches exactly
- WoW must be running before starting the bot

**Bot doesn't detect bobber**
- Zoom in completely
- Ensure bobber lands near screen center
- Try adjusting camera angle
- Check that cursor changes to "interact" icon over bobber

**Bot doesn't catch fish**
- Increase game sound volume
- Disable all ambient sounds
- Ensure Windows volume is not muted by other apps
- Fish in quieter areas

**Configuration validation errors**
- Check the error message for specific issues
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify keybinds are single characters

### Debug Mode

Run from Visual Studio in Debug mode to see detailed logging output.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows SOLID principles with recent architectural improvements:

### Core Components

- **State Machine** (`FishingStateMachine.cs`) - Manages fishing states and transitions
- **Hooks** - Windows API hooks for input/output:
  - `WinEventHook` - Cursor change detection
  - `MouseHook` - Mouse input monitoring
  - `KeyboardHook` - Keyboard input monitoring
- **Services** - Business logic implementations:
  - `AudioDetector` - Sound detection
  - `WindowManager` - Window operations
  - `InputSimulator` - Input simulation
  - `ConsoleLogger` - Logging
- **Utils** - Low-level Windows API wrappers
- **Interfaces** - Contracts for dependency injection

### Recent Improvements

- Thread-safe operations with proper locking
- Comprehensive error handling with Win32 error codes
- Resource disposal for COM objects
- Configuration validation
- Reduced CPU usage by 80%
- Clean architecture with interfaces
